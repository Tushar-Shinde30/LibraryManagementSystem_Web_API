**Library Management System**

**Objective:**
The Library Management System is designed to manage a library's operations, including books, members, and book issues. This project focuses on implementing CRUD operations for the system. I have created entities to represent the data and used DTOs to encapsulate the data being transferred.

Add book to the library<br/>
Retrieve a particular book by its UId<br/>
Retrieve book by its name<br/>

Update book<br/>

**2. Member:**

Add new member<br/>
Retrieve member by UId<br/>
Get all members<br/>
Update member<br/>

**3. Issue:**

When user issues book from the library Issue book entity should be created<br/>
User should be able to get issue book by UId<br/>
User should be able to update existing issue entity<br/>
